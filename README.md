# Eight-Seven

I'm still on the hunt for a password manager that does everything I need:

* Securely store my passwords and let me access them from two computers. 

Vague enough to work, right? Let's flesh that out a bit more: 

* Free Software - I want to deploy my own (looking at you, lastpass)
* Must do encryption of password store *client* side (looking at you, locksmith)
* Multiple clients must be able to make non-conflicting changes that do not
    conflict, e.g. KeePassX + rsync will lose passwords if two copies get out of sync
* Browser integration, a desktop GUI, and a CLI (a.k.a. I want a pony)

The main stumbling block for me is that this is mostly solvable by technology
that I struggle with (JS and various GUI/TUI toolkits). The backend would be
need to be nothing more than a simple interface to a datastore.

Guess I need to suck it up and learn JS :P

## API

The JSON API is self documenting, with the exception of `PasswordStore.data`.
This is the encrypted binary payload that contains the user's passwords.

As plaintext, it should be another JSON document. It should conform to this basic structure:

```
{
    "passwords": [
        {
            "name": "sgrub"
            "username": "carcinoGeneticist"
            "password": "*PASSWORD*"
        },
        {
            "name": "sburb"
            "username": "ghostyTrickster"
            "password": "bluh"
            "url": "https://mspaintadventures.com/"
        }
    ]
}
```

Clients should take care to preserve data they don't edit when saving, e.g. if another client
adds another top-level key `ssh-keys`, care should be taken to preserve that data even in
clients that don't support reading or writing `ssh-keys`.
